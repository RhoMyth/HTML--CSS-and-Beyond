# 🌐 HTML, CSS, and Beyond

Welcome to my **self-learning repository**! 👋  
This is where I practice, experiment, and improve my **frontend development** skills — covering **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** step by step.  

This isn’t a finished project — it’s my **learning pathway**.  
Every file here represents something I’ve learned, tested, or explored while building a strong foundation in web development.

- Accessibility and clean markup  

### 🎨 CSS

### ⚡ JavaScript
- Variables, data types, and functions
